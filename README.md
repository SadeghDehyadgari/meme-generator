# Meme Generator 🎨

This is a practice React project built as part of the **React Beginner Course** from **Scrimba**.

## About the Project
This project is a simple Meme Generator where the user can click a button to load a random meme image and add custom text on top of it.

## What I Learned
While building this project, I practiced key React concepts such as:

- **State management** using `useState`
- **Side effects** using `useEffect`
- **Fetching data from an API**
